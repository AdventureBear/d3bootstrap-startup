# d3bootstrap-startup
Set of startup files for front end HTML/CSS/jQuery project using d3 &amp; Bootstrap (Animate thrown in as well for fun). 

This is a simple skeleton of directorys including an index.html, a javascript directory with blank app.js and a css directory with blank style.css
The index includes links to the local files as well as remote d3 library, you can comment out the one you don't need to save unneccesary processing and page loading. 

This was put together to save me time when starting d3 projects locally from scratch. 


The directory structure looks like this

*index.html
*css
  *style.css
*js
  *app.js
  *d3.min.js
